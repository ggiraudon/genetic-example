# Generation Pause Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Configuration (`config.ts`)
- Added `GENERATION_PAUSE_DURATION: 2000` - 2 seconds pause between generations in milliseconds

### 2. Updated Game Class (`game.ts`)  
- Modified `endGeneration()` method to use the configurable pause duration:
  ```typescript
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.startNewGeneration();
  }, CONFIG.GENERATION_PAUSE_DURATION);
  ```

## How It Works

1. When a generation ends (either all cars are dead or time limit is reached), the `endGeneration()` method is called
2. Generation statistics are saved and a message is shown to the user
3. A `setTimeout` with the configured pause duration (2 seconds) is used before starting the next generation
4. During this pause, users can see the final state of the current generation and read the end-of-generation message

## Benefits

- **Configurable Timing**: The pause duration can be easily adjusted in `config.ts`
- **Better User Experience**: Users have time to observe the results of each generation
- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides a natural break between generations for better visualization

## Current Setting

- **Pause Duration**: 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)

This value can be adjusted in the `CONFIG.GENERATION_PAUSE_DURATION` property in `config.ts` to make the pause longer or shorter as needed.
